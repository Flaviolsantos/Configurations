Basic NIS Configuration Ubuntu 20.04

apt -y install nis (put the domain you want to use, very important)

nano /etc/hosts -> important step if you dont put your hostname with you server ip, its not going to work
add -> ipserver hostname@domain hostname domain 

nano /etc/default/nis
NISSERVER=false ->change to NISSERVER=master ->this change is done so the machine knows that he is the NIS server

nano /etc/ypserv.securenets (which are the subnets alowed in the NIS server)

in the end add mask and network
ex: 255.255.255.0		10.0.0.0

dont comment 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 until you have all nis configuration working when ou have all configs done

nano /etc/var/Makefile
line 52 change false ->true
line 56 change false ->true

/usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m

add all the hosts you done then Ctrl+d -> yes


if this show up do systemctl restart nis and then do the same command again

We need a few minutes to build the databases...

server.azores.pt has been set up as a NIS master server.

if you add users you need to do:

cd /var/yp
make

Client

/etc/hosts -> put the same as the the server (with the server IP and Hosts-> basicly copy paste into it)

apt -y install nis

nano /etc/yp.conf (in this file its told to client which is the NIS SRV)

add in the end -> domain _________ server hostname.domain (ex: domain azores.pt server server.azores.pt)

nano /etc/nsswitch.conf
passwd:         files systemd nis -> add nis
group:          files systemd nis -> add nis
shadow:         files nis -> add nis
gshadow:        files nis -> add nis

hosts:          files dns nis -> add nis

nano /etc/pam.d/common-session
add in the end -> session optional        pam_mkhomedir.so skel=/etc/skel umask=077

systemctl restart nis


to check if the configuration is working login in both (server and cliente) with user created then make a file in one and check /var/homes/user to check if the new file is there
